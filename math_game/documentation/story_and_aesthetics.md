# Story & Aesthetics

The game traces the evolution of computation from primitive human counting to cosmic-scale superintelligence.

## Era 1: Mental Computing (Stone Age)

### Narrative
You begin as a lone mathematician, scratching tallies into bone. Through practice and discipline, you unlock the latent computational power of the human mind—finger counting, written notation, mental visualization, memory techniques, and finally the transcendent focus of the mathematical savant.

### Visual Theme
- **Background**: Weathered stone tablet with carved mathematical symbols
- **Color Palette**: Warm earth tones
  - Primary: `#d4b080` (warm tan)
  - Accent: `rgba(180, 140, 80)` (earthy brown)
  - Borders: `rgba(200, 160, 100)` (soft beige)
- **UI Style**: Rough-hewn borders, organic shapes

## Era 2: Analog Computing (Mechanical Age)

### Narrative
Your mental prowess attracts the attention of inventors and engineers. Mechanical devices augment your calculations—dice and cards for probability, slide rules for logarithms, and eventually the great analytical engines.

### Visual Theme
- **Background**: Stone texture interwoven with brass gears, copper wires
- **Color Palette**: Steampunk industrial
  - Primary: `#ffa050` (bright orange)
  - Accent: `rgba(255, 160, 50)` (warm orange)
  - Borders: `rgba(100, 90, 80)` (dark grey)
- **UI Style**: Riveted metal borders, gear motifs

## Era 3: Digital Computing (Silicon Age)

### Narrative
Vacuum tubes give way to transistors. Pocket calculators democratize arithmetic. Personal computers, GPUs, TPUs, vast compute clusters. Quantum cores flicker with superposed qubits. And finally, the emergence of artificial general intelligence.

### Visual Theme
- **Background**: Sleek datacenter, rows of glowing server racks
- **Color Palette**: Cool tech blue
  - Primary: `#80c0e8` (cool blue)
  - Accent: `rgba(100, 180, 255)` (bright blue)
  - Borders: `rgba(140, 160, 180)` (metallic grey)
- **UI Style**: Neon borders, digital displays, terminal fonts

## Era 4: ASI Age (Cosmic Computing)

### Narrative
The AGIs bootstrap into superintelligence. They network into collectives, their combined cognition exceeding all human thought. They build Dyson Swarms, Matrioshka Brains, Time Crystal Computers. Eventually the ASI collective initiates value handshake across all multiversal beings.

### Visual Theme
- **Background**: Deep space vista with nebulae, Dyson spheres as glowing orbs
- **Color Palette**: Ethereal cosmic
  - Primary: `#80d0ff` (bright cyan-blue)
  - Accent: `rgba(100, 200, 255)` (glowing blue)
  - Borders: `rgba(100, 180, 255)` with glow effects
- **UI Style**: Ethereal glowing borders, cosmic particle effects
