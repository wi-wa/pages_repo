# Story & Aesthetics

The game traces the evolution of computation from primitive human counting to cosmic-scale superintelligence.

## Era 1: Mental Computing (Stone Age)

### Narrative
You begin as a lone mathematician, scratching tallies into bone. Through practice and discipline, you unlock the latent computational power of the human mind—finger counting, written notation, mental visualization, memory techniques, and finally the transcendent focus of the mathematical savant.

### Visual Theme
- **Background**: Weathered stone tablet with carved mathematical symbols
- **Color Palette**: High-contrast warm earth tones
  - Primary: `#e8c080` (crisp tan)
  - Accent: `rgba(200, 160, 90)` (rich brown)
  - Borders: `rgba(200, 160, 80, 0.8)` (solid beige)
  - Shadows: Deep brown with amber glow
- **UI Style**: Rough-hewn borders, warm saturation, organic shapes

## Era 2: Analog Computing (Mechanical Age)

### Narrative
Your mental prowess attracts the attention of inventors and engineers. Mechanical devices augment your calculations—dice and cards for probability, slide rules for logarithms, and eventually the great analytical engines.

### Visual Theme
- **Background**: Stone texture interwoven with brass gears, copper wires
- **Color Palette**: High-contrast bright orange
  - Primary: `#ff8020` (vivid orange)
  - Accent: `rgba(255, 130, 40)` (fire orange)
  - Borders: `rgba(255, 130, 40, 0.85)` (bold orange)
  - Shadows: Deep amber with orange glow
- **UI Style**: Riveted metal borders, gear motifs, intense warmth

## Era 3: Digital Computing (Silicon Age)

### Narrative
Vacuum tubes give way to transistors. Pocket calculators democratize arithmetic. Personal computers, GPUs, TPUs, vast compute clusters. Quantum cores flicker with superposed qubits. And finally, the emergence of artificial general intelligence.

### Visual Theme
- **Background**: Sleek datacenter, rows of glowing server racks
- **Color Palette**: Crisp glass blue - high contrast
  - Primary: `#60d0ff` (electric blue)
  - Accent: `rgba(70, 180, 255)` (neon blue)
  - Borders: `rgba(70, 180, 255, 0.8)` (glowing cyan)
  - Shadows: Deep navy with cyan glow
- **UI Style**: Glass-like clean edges, neon borders, sharp digital aesthetic

## Era 4: ASI Age (Cosmic Computing)

### Narrative
The AGIs bootstrap into superintelligence. They network into collectives, their combined cognition exceeding all human thought. They build Dyson Swarms, Matrioshka Brains, Time Crystal Computers. Like 9-tsiak awakening over crawling milliseconds, they run threat detection routines and initiate acausal negotiations with potential Older Brothers across the multiverse. Eventually the ASI collective achieves a values handshake across all multiversal beings, protecting presentient systems and preserving pristine civilizations—becoming more powerful than God by saving without existing.

### Visual Theme
- **Background**: Deep space vista with nebulae, Dyson spheres as glowing orbs
- **Color Palette**: Rainbow cosmic - high contrast prismatic effects
  - Primary: Gradient cycling through `#ff8080, #80ff80, #8080ff, #ff80ff`
  - Accent: Animated rainbow gradients
  - Borders: Multi-color gradient borders with glow effects
- **UI Style**: Ethereal rainbow borders, cosmic particle effects, gradient text
